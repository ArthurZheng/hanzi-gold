## Install instructions

This app was built for exponent https://exponentjs.com/ which means it is only a couple of quicks away from being run on a simulator or shared on your phones.

To run in the simulator download exponent, run the exponent app, click open project and then there are buttons to install the project on the simulator and run on the simulator. There is also an option to share the app to your phone.
